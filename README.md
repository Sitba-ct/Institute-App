### Descripción

We designed and developed a web application that facilitated tools for the consumers to handle the internal processes of an english institute. 

## Purpose

The development of this application has many reasons.
The most simple AND straightfordward: deliver a product that satisfies the client needs.

That Is just the surface.
The main goals behind this development were to instruct a non-experienced developer in many of múltiple aspects required for a web development, Without compromising deliverable times and features.

The code in the app was 95% developed by someone that started with no React, no Typescript, no SQL, no HTTP, no Authentication mechanisms formal experience.

We put high priority to Interfaces, Services, Models definition, AND naming conventions.

With these we expect inspecting AND understanding the app be intutive AND Easy readable.

Since the app relies in intefaces AND strong type methods, improving perfomance AND extend development should not be an impediment.

Separating business lógic from components was also a priority.

We also took this opportunites to learn about vanguarding projects like Supabase, Vercel, and get used to PostgressSQL syntax

### The app supports:
	• Students management
	• LogIn authentication
	• Courses management
	• Payment Fee register
	• Student/Group Financial state
	• Monthly/Anual reports
	• Role Based functionalities restriction 
	• English/Spanish language selection
	
For this project we handled all the processes behind a software product development, from it's beginning.

### this involved:
	• Business Rules Requirements Recompilation - Client Communication
	• Data Modelling
	• Technology definition
	• Host acquisition and costs estimation
	• Infrastracture management
	 Maintenance Support and Priority Enhancements post delivery Support
	
 ## Modeling
This project uses the Lucidchart flowcharting software to create visual representations of the system.

 ## Scripts to populate Data Base
   These scripts are complex and can be time-consuming to write. However, they can save you a lot of time and effort in the long run.
   This project uses the following scripts to perform complex tasks:
   
• populatePayStudentsWithGroup - A script that populates the PostgreSQL database with data for students who are in a group.
  To access file, click [here](https://github.com/sitba-ct/institute-app/blob/main/script/populatePayStudentsWithGroup.sql)
  
• populatePayStudentsWithNoGroup - A script that populates the PostgreSQL database with data for students who are not in a group.
  To access file, click [here](https://github.com/sitba-ct/institute-app/blob/main/script/populatePayStudentsWithNoGroup.sql)
  
   To create the simple scripts this proyect use the next program:
• Mockaroo - A random data generator that can be used to create realistic data sets for testing and development.

### Stages Time:
	• Business requirements recompilation and data modelling: 4 weeks
	• Technology definition and rampup: 1 week
	• Main Development: 6 months
	• Host and Infrastructure: 1 week
	• Support, Maintenance and Enhancements: 6 weeks
	• Total time: 9 months
	
### Staff:
	• 1 Developer 40hs/week
	• 1 Manager/Developer: 2hs/week




### Technology Stack:
    • React, Typescript, Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML - CSS - SCSS
    • PostgresSQL
    • Supabase (AWS)
    • Postman
    • Axios (http communication)
    • i18next (language support)
    • Jest  unit testing framework for JavaScript
    • Bootstrap A CSS framework
    • SASS - A CSS preprocessor
    • Tsyringe - A dependency injection framework for TypeScript
    • i18next - A library for internationalization and localization

 
Hight Code Quallity:
We do not limit to accomplish the functional requirements, but we promote and put effort in achieving good code quality. This extra effort achieves efficiency and scalability, reducing development time in a long term perspective, reduces bugs, promotes code testability, and decreases ramp-up learning time for future contributors.!
